<p>If you're reading this, chances are you're already on <strong>lloydtorres.com</strong>! Welcome to my website!</p>

<p>This project started in Fall 2014, but it remains an ongoing project as I add new content and continuously polish the site. The site is <a href="https://github.com/lloydtorres/lloydtorres.com.staging">hosted on GitHub Pages</a> and is powered by <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, a static site generator. The site's Material Design-inspired theme, codenamed Cardamon, was built from the ground up by me, with the help of many guides on the Internet.</p>

<p>My site uses <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a>, which is wonderful in setting up columns and responsive elements for both desktop and mobile. Bits and pieces of the site are also powered by JavaScript and jQuery. For instance, the site uses the following JS libraries:</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="http://imagesloaded.desandro.com/">ImagesLoaded</a> to detect if all images have been loaded.</li>
    <li><a href="http://masonry.desandro.com/">Masonry</a> for aligning uneven cards together.</li>
    <li><a href="http://pixelcog.github.io/parallax.js/">Parallax.js</a> for some parallax-related work.</li>
    <li><a href="http://responsiveslides.com/">ResponsiveSlides.js</a> for image slides.</li>
</ul>

<p>The site also uses a <a href="http://charliepark.org/tags-in-jekyll/">Ruby plugin by Charlie Park</a> to generate tag pages using Jekyll. Since GitHub Pages doesn't support custom plugins, I have to build the site locally first before deploying the <code>_site</code> file separately from the source repo.</p>

<p>I try my best to ensure that my site works seamlessly between desktop and mobile users, and that it is consistent across different modern browsers.</p>

<p>If you're interested, there are easter eggs hidden somewhere in the site. Here are some (unrelated) hints:</p>

<ul>
    <li>There is a finite number of pages, but there are infinite ways to see me.</li>
    <li>I leapt through time to see you. Who am I?</li>
</ul>

<p>See if you can find them!</p>

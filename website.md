        <p>If you're reading this, chances are you're already on <strong>lloydtorres.com</strong>! Welcome to my website!</p>

        <p>This project started in Fall 2014, but it remains an ongoing project as I add new content and continuously polish the site. The site is <a href="https://github.com/lloydtorres/lloydtorres.com.staging">hosted on GitHub Pages</a> and is powered by <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, a static site generator. The site's Material Design-inspired theme, codenamed Cardamon, was built from the ground up by me, with the help of many guides in the Internet.</p>

        <p>My site uses <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a>, which is wonderful in setting up layouts and responsive elements for both desktop and mobile. Bits and pieces of the site are also powered by JavaScript and jQuery â€” <a href="http://responsiveslides.com/">ResponsiveSlides.js</a> for image slides and <a href="http://masonry.desandro.com/">Masonry</a> for uneven width alignment, for example.</p>

        <p>I try my best to ensure that my site works seamlessly between desktop and mobile users, and that it is consistent across different modern browsers.</p>

        <p>If you're interested, there are easter eggs hidden somewhere in the site. Here are some (unrelated) hints:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>There is a finite number of pages, but there are infinite ways to see me.</li>
            <li>I leapt through time to see you. Who am I?</li>
        </ul>

        <p>See if you can find them!</p>

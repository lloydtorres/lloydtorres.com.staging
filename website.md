        <p>If you're reading this, chances are you're already on <strong>lloydtorres.com</strong>! Welcome to my website!</p>

        <p>This project started in Fall 2014, but it remains an ongoing project as I add new content and continuously polish the site. The site is <a href="https://github.com/lloydtorres/lloydtorres.github.io">hosted on GitHub</a> and is powered by <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, a static site generator. A lot of the CSS/Sass and HTML/Liquid templates used by the site were created by me, with the help of many guides in the Internet.</p>

        <p>My site is powered by <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a>, which is wonderful in setting up layouts and responsive elements for both desktop and mobile. Bits and pieces of the site are also powered by JavaScript and jQuery â€” <a href="http://responsiveslides.com/">ResponsiveSlides.js</a> for image slides and <a href="http://masonry.desandro.com/">Masonry</a> for uneven width alignment, for example.</p>

        <p>I try my best to ensure that the site works wonderfully for both desktop and mobile users, and that it looks the same across different modern browsers.</p>

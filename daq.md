        <ul>
            <li>Created a utility in LabVIEW to read sensor data from a National Instruments DAQ device for rocketry engine tests.</li>
            <li>Read filtered strain gauge and pressure data and displayed graphs, averages and maximums to the user.</li>
            <li>Worked with upper-year electrical engineering students to debug and fix DAQ hardware issues.</li>
            <li>Attended a National Instruments seminar to learn more about data acquisition techniques.</li>

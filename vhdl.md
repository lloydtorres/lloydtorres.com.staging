* Simple controllers in VHDL for the [Altera DE2 board](http://www.altera.com/education/univ/materials/boards/de2/unv-de2-board.html) 
(Cyclone II FPGA) for a Digital Circuits group project.
* Developed two main combinatorial circuits - ALU and elevator controller.
* Developed a large traffic controller sequential circuit with different modes based on user input.
* Used various techniques to simplify logic (e.g. Karnaugh maps, De Morgan's laws, implicants, state diagrams).

**Interesting notes:**

* This projects showed me the difference between coding for normal computers and embedded systems - embedded systems tend to be 
  more fickle when it comes to how you implement things.

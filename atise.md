## The Story

<p><strong>Atise</strong> was built over 30 hours at Hack the North 2015 by myself, <a href="http://davidvuong.ca/">David</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/TheresaDeCola">Theresa</a> and Anas. Theresa and Anas focused on the Android frontend while David and I worked on the backend and integration.</p>

<p>Atise is powered by <a href="https://www.firebase.com/">Firebase</a> for its backend. Firebase allows us to easily store and retrieve data in real time, which allowed us to focus our efforts in building an amazing app experience instead of tinkering with the backend. The payment process is handled by <a href="https://www.braintreepayments.com/">Braintree</a>, which provides an easy-to-use API for charging accounts.</p>

<h2 id="stepcounter">Step Counter and Navigator App</h2>

<img src="/images/stepcounter.png" width="200px" title="Step Counter and Navigator App" alt="Step Counter and Navigator App"/>

This is an Android app developed for an Embedded Systems group project. It uses a basic state machine to detect footsteps, and combines that with magnetometer data to determine the user's bearing and displacement. Finally, we used all of this data to track the user's movement on a map, and with A* pathfinding, we could provide directions to any point in the room.

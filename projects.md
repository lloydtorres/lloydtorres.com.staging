<img src="/images/space_screenshot.png" width="300px" title="Space Invaders Recreated" alt="Space Invaders Recreated"/>

A recreation of **Space Invaders** in Java for a school game project, first created on February 2013. I've recently updated it to allow gesture control with Thalmic Labs's Myo armband using a Lua script.

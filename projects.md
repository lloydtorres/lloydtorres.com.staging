## Space Invaders Recreated

<img src="/images/space_screenshot.png" width="300px" title="Space Invaders Recreated" alt="Space Invaders Recreated"/>

A recreation of **Space Invaders** in Java for a school game project, first created on February 2013. I've recently updated it to allow gesture control with Thalmic Labs's Myo armband using a Lua script.

Space Invaders is copyrighted by Taito Corporation. The code is provided by me on a GNU GPL v3.0 license. You can [check it out](https://github.com/lloydtorres/space-invaders-recreated) on GitHub!

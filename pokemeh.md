<p>You may have heard that the idea for Pokémon GO came from one of the hackathon winners of Hack the North 2014.</p>

<p class="featuretext-md"><strong>PokéMeh</strong>, introduced at Waterloo's own TerribleHack IV and winner of the 'Sponsored by Zynga' and 'Most Pokémon' awards, is the next logical step. <strong>PokéMeh</strong> aims to be the next 10-million-download app-killer.</p>

<p>Pokémon GO encourages its players to go out and be active, potentially exposing them to the dangers of the outside world. PokéMeh ensures the safety of its players by making sure they stay put. Using the innovative Myo gesture control armband, PokéMeh enforces non-movement by tracking player movements with state-of-the-art movement sensors.</p>

<p>Don't move an inch and keep catching those Slowpokes! This begs the question...</p>

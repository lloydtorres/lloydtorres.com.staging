        <p><strong>Icebreakr</strong> is an Android app that lets you meet new and interesting people around you!</p>

        <p>Powered by the <a href="http://estimote.com/">Estimote beacon</a>, Icebreakr lets you see other users nearby who'd like to meet up. Icebreakr lets you set a message and interests for other people to see, giving you the power to reach out to like-minded people. Using the Estimote, Icebreakr can let you know how far you are from everyone.</p>

        <p>Icebreakr is ideal for use in conventions, meetups and other crowded events where meeting people could be a hassle. With Icebreakr, awkward introductions are finally a thing of the past! Interested? Simply login with your Twitter account on the Icebreakr app to get started.</p>

        <p>Icebreakr was developed at WearHacks Toronto on the weekend of 8â€”10 May 2015. Icebreakr uses Android, the Estimote SDK and the Twitter SDK (via Fabric) for its frontend and Node.js and MongoDB for its backend. I was primarily responsible for the frontend.</p>

        <p>The Estimote itself broadcasts nothing but a unique ID, so we had a server that actually stored users' information. Our app communicated with the server using <a href="https://github.com/mcxiaoke/android-volley">Volley</a>. To build the UI itself, I used libraries such as jpardogo's <a href="https://github.com/jpardogo/PagerSlidingTabStrip">Pager Sliding Tab Strip</a> and afollestad's <a href="https://github.com/afollestad/material-dialogs">Material Dialogs</a>.</p>

I honestly can't believe why I've never used <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> before! It's AMAZING and I LOVE IT! It makes web dev much more easier and more fun! I was so excited to use it that I pulled an all-nighter on Halloween night to start revamping my site.

With Bootstrap, it's now super easy to make site elements responsive to user input. It's also easier to align elements along the screen, which makes for a cleaner look. Also, I don't have to worry as much about formatting on mobile since Bootstrap takes care of it!

So far only the [Projects page](/projects/) has been built from scratch with Bootstrap in mind - go check it out! It looks much nicer and modern now, plus the user isn't immediately slammed by a wall of text when they go there. Over the next few weeks I might consider rebuilding other pages with Bootstrap as well - I'm excited!

I've also added [ResponsiveSlides.js](http://responsiveslides.com/) to some of the project pages (finally figured out how to get Jekyll to work nice with local Javascript files). It took a while to figure out how to set it up, and I'm still not entirely satisfied with how it is, so that's still a work with progress.

Anyways, shoutout to [@david_valleau](https://twitter.com/david_valleau) ([check out](http://davidvalleau.com/) his site) for showing me Bootstrap! Also thanks to many others whose site sources I went through for Bootstrap examples. :P

TL;DR: <3 Bootstrap

I decided to drop by the University of Waterloo's <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/astrophysics-and-gravitation/gustav-bakos-observatory">Gustav Bakos Observatory</a> yesterday night on a whim, despite the fact that it was somewhat overcast. The observatory opens its doors to the public on the first Wednesday of every month. It was raining the last time it was open, so I decided to take advantage of this opportunity.

To be honest, since the event doesn't seem to be well advertised (as far as I know), I was expecting there to be few people present in the event. To my surprise, there was a full house during the event - the original room for the opening talk didn't have enough room so the presenter had to move to the larger room across the hall. There were people from all over the place there - from university students to local families visiting. It was heartwarming to see that public interest in astronomy remains high!

The event started with a talk from an astronomer, who was a Masters student at Waterloo. He quickly went over pretty basic stuff that I kind of knew already - such as the composition of Jupiter's Gallilean moons, the relative sizes of planets and large telescopes in use elsewhere.

Afterwards there was a rush to line up to the observatory's telescope - the line streched out for more than three flights of stairs. I was fortunately one of the first ones there.

The observatory has a 12-inch telescope. Since it was kind of overcast and there were random clouds in the sky, the only object we could really clearly see was the Moon. Nevertheless, being able to see the Moon up close - with its various maria and craters - was still a wonderful sight to see. This actually marks the first time I've looked into a non-toy telescope. It was truly amazing how much detail you could see. I tried to take a picture through the lens but the resulting image doesn't come close to capturing the beauty of actually seeing it in person.

Astronomy is awesome.

On a related note, I'm looking forward to seeing [*Interstellar*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstellar_(film)) soon!

Over the past three days I've been revisiting an old project of mine - a 
[recreation of Space Invaders](https://github.com/lloydtorres/space-invaders-recreated) in Java. It originally started out as a 
school project - in high school, we were given the task of developing a simple game in our first foray into object-oriented 
programming. Space Invaders seemed like a challenging project so I went with it.

Due to time constraints, I was only able to finish the core game before the due date. The game itself was playable - you had a 
ship you could move around, and you could destroy an endless stream of aliens as they slowly zigzagged down the sky. That was the 
extent of it however, and it left something to be desired.

After sitting somewhere in my hard drive for more than a year, I reopened it during a bout of procrastination one July afternoon, 
interested in seeing if I could still decipher my code from a different time. Surprisingly, despite not having comments to 
consult, I was able to figure out what I was trying to do when I wrote the code. With that knowledge, I was able to refactor the 
code and included comments to better explain it to my future self.

I now had nicer code, but at its core it was still the same unfinished product. I left the project once more, as I had more 
urgent things to finish that time, and I couldn't procrastinate any longer.

Now that I have free time due to co-op, I decided to actually finish what I started a year ago. To my surprise, I was able to 
implement features pretty quickly (with the help of Stack Overflow, of course!). In three days, I was able to implement sound, 
better animation, a pause mechanism, an initial main menu and high score tracking. When I first started this project a year ago, 
such a feat probably would have taken a week or so to complete. Granted, I did have a pretty good framework in place already.

So, after more than a year of collecting dust, my recreation of Space Invaders is finally complete! I find that the extra features 
I've added makes it feel more authentic and exciting. You can check it out on [GitHub](https://github.com/lloydtorres/space-invaders-recreated)
